  # Fundraising Analysis Project  
  For the future fundraising projects to be successful, we helped Louise to perform analysis on existing campaign data and here are what we have found :
  
  #### Fundraising Outcome Based On Goals :
       Campaigns have goal less than or equal $10,000 have successful rate higher then 50%
       Campaigns will be most likely fail when goals are set higher than $20,000 
       Canceled campaign percentage start to kick up at gaols that are higher then $5000
   These analysis and observation can be seen as plot here :
