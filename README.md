  # Fundraising Analysis Project
  For the future fundraising projects to be successful, we helped Louise to perform analysis on existing campaign data. There are total 4114 campaign data to be used for analysis.   This is a large data set and we only have short amount of time to analyze. If we do not have a proper methods it could cost us weeks to have the results and set the strategy  to   make sure we will have successful campaigns in the future,and here are what we have found :
  
  #### Fundraising Outcome Based On Launch Date:
       May will be the best time of the year to have fundraising. This is the time when people start spending : travel, vacation, etcs
       December will be the worse time of the year to have fundraising. This is the time when people start saving to pay taxes : property tax, HOA annually 
       due,Chrsitmas gifts spedning, etcs
       Analysis are base on these plots : https://github.com/ttan0408/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png
  #### Fundraising Outcome Based On Goals :
       Campaigns have goal less than or equal $10,000 have successful rate higher then 50%
       Campaigns will be most likely fail when goals are set higher than $20,000 
       There are no canceled campains for Plays , which indicates people interesting to go to the event more than other campaigns. So the outcomes for Plays campaign either              success or failure. 
       These analysis and observation can be seen as plot here : https://github.com/ttan0408/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcome_Based_On_Goal.png
       
 We can create the plots that show the most sucessful campaigns based on subcategory so that in the future we will focus most of resources on these, for example play campaigns
